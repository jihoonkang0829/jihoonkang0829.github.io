                    I am passionate and interested in machine learning, and possess various multiple academic, project, and industry experience in machine learning. I have taken basic machine learning courses, including applied machine learning, and machine learning in economics.
                    To further challenge myself, I am currently taking a graduate level course, titled <a href="https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/cs542/" class="link">statistical reinforcement learning</a>. I have participated in multiple

                            <p> With the emergence of the novel coronavirus, our society has witnessed soar in racial discrimination and hate crime since last year. We propose a model to predict occurences of hate crimes to contribute to the efficient prevention
                                of the hate crimes.
                                <br>We first collect racial discrimination-related event instances with New York Times API, especially the date, location and the respective occurences of the crimes.
                                <br>Based on the data collected, we train a deep learning model to predict occurences and locations of future possible discrimanation-related events.
                                <br>We create a recurrent model that predicts the following week's hate crime occurences in state level, based on the previous 4 weeks' occurences by states.
